# ABRÈGE - Summarize Your Readings

ABRÈGE allows you to quickly summarize the content of a webpage or selected text using ChatGPT. The goal is to help you abbreviate your readings, especially when conducting technological watch. By clicking on the extension icon, the current page's URL is sent to ChatGPT for summarization. Additionally, you can select any text on a webpage and use the context menu to get a summary generated by ChatGPT.
